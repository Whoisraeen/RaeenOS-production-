# RaeenOS Development Checklist

This checklist outlines the major development areas and features for RaeenOS, a next-generation desktop operating system combining the strengths of Windows and macOS.

**Goal:** To build a production-ready OS that is a luxury product out of the box, deeply customizable, universally compatible, developer/gamer-friendly, privacy/security-focused, and AI-native.
