## Sandbox Profiles

The framework includes several predefined sandbox profiles:

- **strict** - Very restrictive settings for untrusted applications
- **default** - Moderate restrictions suitable for most applications
- **permissive** - Relaxed restrictions for trusted applications
- **developer** - Developer-friendly settings with extended access
- **system** - System process settings with minimal restrictions

## API Usage

### Basic Security Operations

```c
// Initialize security framework
int ret = security_init();

// Check capability
if (security_check_capability(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) == 0) {
    // Process has admin capability
}

// Create security context
security_context_t* ctx;
ret = security_create_context("user_u:user_r:user_t:s0", &ctx);

// Apply sandbox to process
sandbox_profile_t* profile;
ret = security_create_sandbox("default", &profile);
ret = security_apply_sandbox(process, profile);
```

### Cryptographic Operations

```c
// Generate encryption key
crypto_key_t* key;
ret = crypto_generate_key(CRYPTO_ALG_AES, 256, &key);

// Encrypt data
void* ciphertext;
size_t cipher_len;
ret = crypto_encrypt_data(key, plaintext, len, &ciphertext, &cipher_len);

// Store key securely
ret = crypto_store_key(key, "my_encryption_key");
```

### Security Event Logging

```c
// Log security event
security_event_t event = {
    .event_id = security_generate_event_id(),
    .timestamp = get_system_time(),
    .type = SECURITY_EVENT_ACCESS_DENIED,
    .severity = 5,
    .blocked = true
};
strcpy(event.description, "Access denied to sensitive file");
security_log_event(&event);
```

## Configuration

### Compile-Time Configuration

The security framework can be configured at compile time using various flags:

```makefile
# Enable debug mode
CFLAGS += -DDEBUG

# Set security debug level
CFLAGS += -DSECURITY_DEBUG_LEVEL=2

# Enable specific security modules
CFLAGS += -DSECURITY_CORE_MODULE
CFLAGS += -DMAC_MODULE
CFLAGS += -DSANDBOX_MODULE
```

### Runtime Configuration

Security policies and parameters can be adjusted at runtime:

```c
// Set security level
security_set_level(SECURITY_LEVEL_HIGH);

// Configure audit policy
security_set_audit_policy(AUDIT_MASK_ALL, true);

// Set IDS parameters
ids_set_parameters(50, 300, true); // threshold=50, window=300s, learning=true
```

## Integration with Kernel Subsystems

The security framework integrates with major kernel subsystems:

- **Process Management** - Security context inheritance, capability enforcement

## Performance Characteristics

The security framework is designed for high performance:

- **Access Control**: < 10 microseconds per check
- **Cryptographic Operations**: Hardware-accelerated when available
- **Audit Logging**: Circular buffer with async disk writes
- **Memory Overhead**: < 5% of total system memory
- **CPU Overhead**: < 5% under normal workloads

## Security Properties

The framework protects against:
- Memory corruption exploits (buffer overflows, use-after-free)
- Privilege escalation attacks
- Data exfiltration and unauthorized access
- Network-based attacks and intrusions
