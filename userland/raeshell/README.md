# RaeShell

RaeShell is the command-line interface for RaeenOS, designed to be powerful, intuitive, and deeply integrated with the operating system.

## Vision

RaeShell aims to combine the best features of traditional UNIX shells (like bash and zsh) with the object-oriented nature of PowerShell, while also introducing AI-native features.

## Planned Features

*   **AI-Powered Commands:** Natural language command execution, command suggestions, and script generation.
*   **Object-Oriented Pipeline:** Pipe objects, not just text, between commands.
*   **Extensible Plugin System:** Create and share custom plugins to extend the shell's functionality.
*   **Modern Terminal UI:** Rich text formatting, syntax highlighting, and integrated graphics support.
*   **Deep OS Integration:** Access and manage system resources, applications, and settings directly from the shell.
