## Risk Management and Escalation

### Risk Monitoring

All agents must monitor for these risk categories:

#### Technical Risks:
- **Complexity Underestimation**: Task more complex than expected
- **Integration Conflicts**: Incompatible approaches between agents
- **Performance Issues**: Cannot meet performance benchmarks
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security flaws discovered

#### Process Risks:
- **Communication Breakdown**: Agents not coordinating effectively
- **Dependency Delays**: Blocked waiting for other agents
- **Quality Issues**: Code quality below standards
- **Timeline Pressure**: Rushing to meet deadlines

### Escalation Procedures

#### Level 1: Peer Resolution (2 hours)
- Try to resolve directly with relevant agents
- Document issue and attempted resolution

#### Level 2: Phase Lead (4 hours)
- Escalate to phase lead if peer resolution fails
- Provide detailed context and attempted solutions

#### Level 3: Architecture Board (8 hours)
- For architectural conflicts or major technical decisions
- Requires formal presentation of alternatives

#### Level 4: Emergency (Immediate)
- Critical path blocked or security vulnerability
- All agents notified, immediate response required
