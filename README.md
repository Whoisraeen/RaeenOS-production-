# RaeenOS

**Tagline:** “Design meets Depth.”

RaeenOS is a next-generation desktop operating system that combines the powerful customization, compatibility, and openness of Windows with the elegant design, security, and polish of macOS. RaeenOS is not a Linux distro — it is a completely new OS with its own modern kernel and architecture, designed from scratch.
